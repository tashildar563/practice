### SOLID Principal
* Single responsibility Principle
  * A class should have only one reason to change
    * ex Imagine a baker who is reponsible for baking bread. the baker's role is to focus on the task of baking bread.
* Open closed Principle
  * Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
  * which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.
* Liskov Substitution Principle
  * Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes
  * this principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any expected behaviour.
* Interface segregation Principle
  * do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them.
  * avoid creating fat interface and give preference to small interfaces.
* Dependency Inversion Principle
  * High level module should not depend on low level modules. both should depend on abstraction.

### Need for SOLID
* it makes code easier to maintain.
* it supports growth  in software.
* Encourages flexibility.
